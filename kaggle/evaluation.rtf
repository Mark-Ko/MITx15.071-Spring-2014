\f1\b\fs32 \cf2 For every observation in the test set
\b0 , submission files should contain two columns: UserID and Probability1. The submission should be a csv file. The UserID should just be the corresponding UserID column from the dataset. The Probability1 column should be the predicted probability of the outcome 1 for that UserID.\

\cf2 As an example of how to generate a submission file in R, suppose that your test set probability predictions are called "testPred" and your test data set is called "test". Then you can generate a submission file called "submission.csv" by running the following two lines of code in R (if you copy and paste these lines of code into R, the quotes around submission.csv might not read properly - please delete and re-type the quotes if you get an error):\
submission\'a0= data.frame(UserID = test$UserID, Probability1 = testPred)\uc0\u8232 write.csv(submission, \'93submission.csv\'94, row.names=FALSE)\'a0\
You should then submit the file "submission.csv" by clicking on "Make a Submission" on\'a0the Kaggle website.\
The generated file should have the following format:\
